                <p class="parag1" title="">
                    Founded in 1999 by passionate athletes, who won numerous
                    awards and medals for their high-level performances, Magnus
                    and Malene teamed up to start the Catharsis Park and share
                    their passion and skills with their fans and all the people
                    wanting to learn, while having fun at the same time. In 2009,
                    the park grew and became so popular that another level of
                    management needed to be implemented, and so Sophia came in the
                    picture with her great managerial skills and became CEO of our
                    park. When the park started offering high level archery
                    activities, medalist Jean came to work with us. Our team of
                    professionally trained instructors is looking forward to meeting
                    you, and to initiate or perfect your skills.

                    Welcome & see you soon!
